# 0.2 Models

Summary:
Define conceptual models for phases and cards used by the kanban app.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Phase model includes number, label, and path
- [x] Card model includes code, slug, status (from folder), and file path
- [x] Models capture frontmatter fields, including optional `parallelizable` flag
- [x] Models store section text as parsed content

Notes:
- Treat filename prefix `<phase>.<task>` as the card code.
- Keep models implementation-agnostic for now.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
- 2025-11-23: Moved to in-progress on branch implement/models.
- 2025-11-23: Implemented phase/card models, parser, and tests; xcodebuild test run passed.
- 2025-11-23: Moved to done.
