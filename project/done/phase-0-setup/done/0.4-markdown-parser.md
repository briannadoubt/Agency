# 0.4 Markdown Parser

Summary:
Describe a parser that reads card frontmatter and structured sections from markdown files.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Parser reads YAML frontmatter fields (`owner`, `agent_flow`, `agent_status`, `branch`, `risk`, `review`, `parallelizable`)
- [x] Parser captures title, Summary text, and Acceptance Criteria checkboxes
- [x] Parser extracts Notes and History sections intact

Notes:
- Preserve checkbox state (`[ ]` vs `[x]`).
- Handle absent sections gracefully with defaults.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
- 2025-11-23: Moved to in-progress on branch implement/markdown-parser.
- 2025-11-23: Implemented markdown parser + tests; xcodebuild -scheme Agency -destination 'platform=macOS,arch=arm64' test.
