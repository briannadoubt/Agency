# 0.1 Conventions

Summary:
Define folder hierarchy, card naming, and status-as-folder rules for the markdown-driven kanban structure.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Repository contains `project/` root with phase folders
- [x] Each phase folder has `backlog/`, `in-progress/`, and `done/` status directories
- [x] Cards follow `<phase>.<task>-slug.md` naming convention
- [x] Parsing tolerates missing/extra sections; validation errors are surfaced without crashing

Notes:
- Keep naming lowercase and kebab-case for slugs.
- Status is inferred solely from the containing folder.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
