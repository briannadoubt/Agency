# 0.3 Scanner

Summary:
Describe a scanner that traverses `project/` to build in-memory representations of phases and cards.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Scanner discovers phase directories named `phase-<N>-<label>`
- [x] Scanner finds `backlog/`, `in-progress/`, and `done/` within each phase
- [x] Scanner enumerates card markdown files and extracts status from parent folder
- [x] Scanner reads optional `parallelizable` flag from frontmatter with a sensible default
- [x] Handles 1k cards in <500ms scan on M-series Mac; debounced filesystem watcher keeps view current

Notes:
- Treat missing status folders as errors to surface early.
- Ensure deterministic ordering (e.g., sorted by phase number, then task code).

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
- 2025-11-24: Moved to in-progress on branch implement/scanner.
