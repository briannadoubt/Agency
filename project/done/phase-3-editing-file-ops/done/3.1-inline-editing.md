# 3.1 Inline Editing

Summary:
Provide inline editing for summary and notes, render acceptance criteria as checkboxes, and write modifications back to the markdown file while preserving untouched formatting.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Summary and Notes fields are editable in-app
- [x] Acceptance criteria render as checkboxes and persist their state
- [x] Saving rewrites markdown, preserving unedited sections and formatting
- [x] Detects on-disk changes before save (optimistic locking or merge); preserves frontmatter order

Notes:
- Preserve checkbox state markers `[ ]` vs `[x]`.
- Consider diff-based rewrite to minimize churn.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
