# 5.4 Supported Agent Flows

Summary:
Specify behaviors for `implement`, `review`, and `research` flows, including expected inputs, outputs, frontmatter updates, and History/log updates, consistent with `project/XPC_ARCHITECTURE.md` streaming/log model.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Document inputs/outputs for implement, review, research flows
- [x] Define frontmatter changes per flow and success/failure states
- [x] Outline how History entries are appended for each flow

Notes:
- Include guidance on checklist updates for implement flow.
- Keep behaviors deterministic for automation.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
