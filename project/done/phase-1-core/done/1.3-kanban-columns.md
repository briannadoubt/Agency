# 1.3 Kanban Columns

Summary:
Render three vertical columns (Backlog, In-Progress, Done) with drag-and-drop between them, smooth rearrangement animations, and disk moves to reflect status changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Columns show cards for each status with correct sorting
- [x] Drag-and-drop moves cards between columns and updates files on disk
- [x] Animations run smoothly when cards move or reorder
- [x] Filesystem watcher reflects external changes within ~300ms; empty/error states are shown gracefully

Notes:
- Use file moves to reflect status changes; keep operations atomic.
- Consider haptics/feedback on drop success.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-23: Implemented kanban columns with drag-and-drop, atomic status moves, animations, and regression tests.
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
