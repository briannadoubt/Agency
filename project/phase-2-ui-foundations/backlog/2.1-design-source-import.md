# 2.1 Design Source Import

Summary:
Gather the provided screenshots and design document into the repo to anchor UI decisions, and distill key tokens (colors, typography, spacing, motion) into a short reference.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Screenshots/design doc stored under `project/phase-2-ui-foundations/design/`
- [ ] Notes capture palette (background, accent, risk colors) and typography scale from the doc
- [ ] Motion cues (durations/curves) and spacing/radius callouts are summarized for downstream cards

Notes:
- Keep source assets read-only; no raster edits needed.
- Extract hex values and font names directly from the design doc where present.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
