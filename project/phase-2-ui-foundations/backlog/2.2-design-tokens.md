# 2.2 Design Tokens

Summary:
Define reusable tokens for colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, and badges in a single Swift file to drive all SwiftUI views.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Tokens live in `DesignSystem/Tokens.swift` (or similar) with public static helpers
- [ ] Color definitions include dark backgrounds, accent blue, and risk levels (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Typography scale matches design doc; exposes headline, body, monospace for code-like text
- [ ] Spacing and corner radius constants documented; shadows/border opacities defined
- [ ] Includes spacing grid and accessibility tokens; preview/snapshot references captured for regressions

Notes:
- Provide previews/examples for quick visual validation.
- Keep values in one place to avoid drift; no hard-coded colors in views.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
