# 2.4 Card Component

Summary:
Build the Kanban card UI: dark surface with hover state, phase.task badge, risk badge color coding, summary truncation, progress bar, and metadata pills.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Card shows phase.task (monospace), risk badge (green/yellow/red), summary (2-line truncation), progress bar from criteria counts
- [ ] Metadata pills for owner, branch (with icon), parallelizable flag, and agent_status rendered compactly
- [ ] Hover effect lightens background and border as per tokens
- [ ] Contrast verified against tokens; hover respects reduced-motion fallback

Notes:
- Accept props for counts and risk; avoid recalculating inside view.
- Reuse tokens from 2.2; no hard-coded colors.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
