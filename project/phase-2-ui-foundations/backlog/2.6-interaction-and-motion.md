# 2.6 Interaction & Motion

Summary:
Define motion and interaction rules for hover, drag, and modal transitions, with reduced-motion fallbacks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Animation durations/curves documented and applied to card hover, drag/drop, and modal transitions
- [ ] Reduced Motion settings respected with toned-down or disabled animations
- [ ] Keyboard/focus/hover affordances specified for interactive elements
- [ ] Motion tokens (durations/curves) documented across cards, modal, drag/drop with reduced-motion behavior

Notes:
- Prefer SwiftUI’s spring/interactive spring where appropriate; align with design doc cues.
- Document motion tokens alongside color/spacing tokens.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
