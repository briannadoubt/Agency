# 2.3 Layout, Surfaces, and Header

Summary:
Establish board-level layout rules (gutters, column widths), card chrome, and the top header bar with vibrancy/blur per the design.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Header bar shows title/subtitle with macOS vibrancy/blur styling and consistent padding
- [x] Board spacing defined (horizontal/vertical), with three-column grid per phase
- [x] Card surface specs (background shade, border opacity, radius) documented and reusable

Notes:
- Use SwiftUI `Toolbar`/`Material` where appropriate for the header.
- Columns should be scrollable independently if needed; respect design spacing.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
