# 2.8 Handoff to Existing Screens

Summary:
Integrate tokens/components into existing Phase 1 shell (loader, sidebar, columns) and prepare for Phase 2 editing flows.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Header, board layout, and card component wired into the current Kanban shell
- [x] Detail modal hooked up behind card tap with view/edit/raw modes stubbed
- [x] Clear checklist of remaining Phase 2 work that will consume the design system

Notes:
- Keep state management minimal; focus on visual wiring and API surface for later data plumbing.
- Add TODOs where Phase 2 editing logic will attach.

Remaining Phase 2 TODOs:
- [x] Replace local card edits with shared editing pipeline + validation
- [x] Wire live refresh of board/columns from watcher stream
- [x] Add inline acceptance-criteria editing within cards
- [x] Surface attachments/comments once design tokens cover them

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
