# 6.7 Docs & Guardrails

Summary:
Document the new agent-driven phase creation flow, update roadmap/workflow references, and add guardrails for safe usage until MCP integration arrives.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] PROJECT_WORKFLOW.md updated to mention agent-driven phase creation and plan artifacts
- [ ] ROADMAP.md updated with Phase 6 scope and MCP deferral note
- [ ] CLI usage doc describing arguments, outputs, exit codes, and examples
- [ ] User-facing guidance in-app or README: what the plan artifact contains and how to manually edit/apply
- [ ] Feature flag/environment toggle documented for enabling/disabling the flow

Notes:
- Keep docs concise; link to existing agent flow docs for shared concepts.

Alignment:
- Sets expectations for users and keeps rollout controlled while MCP work is pending.
