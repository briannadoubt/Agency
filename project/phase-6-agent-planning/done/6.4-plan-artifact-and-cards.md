# 6.4 Plan Artifact & Card Materialization

Summary:
Define the plan artifact produced by the agent, persist it in the new phase, and (optionally) auto-create cards from the plan using existing card templates.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Plan artifact stored at `phase-N-<label>/backlog/N.0-phase-plan.md` with standard sections + runID History entry
- [x] Artifact includes structured list of proposed tasks (titles, acceptance criteria, rationale) in human-readable markdown
- [x] Optional auto-materialization creates cards via CardCreator using plan data; collisions are handled gracefully
- [x] UI offers “Create cards from plan” when auto-materialization is off or partial
- [x] Resulting phase validates cleanly with ConventionsValidator

Notes:
- Keep artifact format stable so future MCP implementation can read it.
- Include a checksum or version tag in the artifact frontmatter if helpful for migrations.

Alignment:
- Ensures transparency of agent output and smooth transition to manual editing or future MCP tooling.
