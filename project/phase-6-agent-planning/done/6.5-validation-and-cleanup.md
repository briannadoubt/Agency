# 6.5 Validation & Cleanup

Summary:
Update validation and lifecycle handling so newly created phases + plan artifacts pass conventions, and ensure temp resources/processes are cleaned up on success or cancellation.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Validator recognizes new structure
- [ ] ConventionsValidator recognizes plan artifacts and new phase structure as valid (no false errors)
- [ ] Loader reload after phase creation surfaces validation issues clearly if present
- [ ] Temp directories/log files from the plan run are removed or quarantined per retention policy
- [ ] Cancellation/failed runs leave no orphaned processes, descriptors, or partially written files
- [ ] Logging captures cleanup events for debugging

Notes:
- Mirror the guarantees and tests from 5.9 streaming/cleanup where applicable.

Alignment:
- Keeps Phase 6 flows stable and safe while MCP is deferred.

History:
- 2025-11-28: Card drafted for Phase 6 planning.
- 2025-11-28: Moved to In Progress on branch implement/6-5-validation-and-cleanup.
- 2025-11-28: Completed and merged to main.
