# 6.3 UI Phase Creation Flow

Summary:
Add UI entry points to start agent-driven phase creation: sidebar button + empty-state CTA, prompt for phase label and optional starter task hints, then launch the plan flow with live feedback.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Sidebar Project section shows “Add Phase (with Agent…)”; empty-state CTA appears when no phases loaded
- [ ] Prompt captures phase label, optional starter task hints, and toggle for auto-creating cards from plan
- [ ] Submission triggers the plan flow, shows log/progress UI, and disables duplicate submits while running
- [ ] On success, the new phase appears in the list and selection updates appropriately
- [ ] User-facing errors surfaced for invalid input or backend failures; dialog dismisses cleanly

Notes:
- Keep styling consistent with existing design system; avoid dark-mode-only patterns.
- Ensure accessibility labels for the new controls and dialog fields.

Alignment:
- Delivers the user-visible affordance for Phase 6 without MCP dependencies.
