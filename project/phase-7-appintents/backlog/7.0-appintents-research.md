# 7.0 AppIntents Planning

Summary:
Expand the Phase 6 plan to cover AppIntents, ensuring we know what to research, how to integrate, and how to keep builds warning-free.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document Phase 6 goals for AppIntents, including desired user flows and outcomes
- [ ] Call out follow-on cards (e.g., 6.1 AppIntents research) and any additional implementation cards needed
- [ ] Capture dependencies/constraints (platform versions, entitlements, privacy copy, Shortcuts surfaces) to inform the plan
- [ ] Define validation expectations with warnings-as-errors enabled (unit/UI coverage, simulator setup)

Notes:
- Compile-time warnings are treated as errors; plans must keep the integration clean.
- Coordinate intent surfaces with upcoming UI flows once available.

History:
- 2025-11-23: Card created by agent.
- 2025-11-23: Updated to reflect expanded Phase 6 planning needs and linkage to follow-on cards.
