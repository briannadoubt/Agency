# 11.1 Wizard Shell & Navigation

Summary:
Create the main wizard sheet with step management, header bar, and navigation controls.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] NewProjectWizardView as sheet presentation
- [x] Header bar: sparkle icon + "New Project" title + X close button
- [x] WizardStep enum: .goalInput, .generating, .reviewRoadmap, .scaffolding, .complete
- [x] Step transitions with animation
- [x] Menu bar item: File > New Project... (Cmd+Shift+N)
- [x] Sheet presentation triggered from ContentView or welcome state
- [x] Escape key dismisses wizard (with confirmation if data entered)

Notes:
Sheet should be ~600pt wide. Dark theme with rounded corners matching screenshots. No step indicator dots - steps flow naturally.
