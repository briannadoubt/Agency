# 11.3 Roadmap Generation & Review

Summary:
Generate roadmap from goal, show loading state, then present editable roadmap with live preview.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] GeneratingStepView with loading animation
- [x] Circular progress with sparkle icon inside
- [x] "Architecting your workflow..." headline
- [x] Descriptive subtext about analyzing requirements
- [x] RoadmapReviewStepView after generation completes
- [x] Header: "Review Roadmap" with "Back" button and "Create Project" button (blue)
- [x] Subhead: "Edit the markdown plan below to refine phases and tasks."
- [x] Left panel: ROADMAP.MD label + scrollable TextEditor with monospace font
- [x] Right panel: Preview card showing parsed Phases count and Tasks count
- [x] Right panel: Tips card with markdown formatting guidance
- [x] Live parsing: preview updates as user edits markdown
- [x] Error state if generation fails with retry option

Notes:
Current implementation uses placeholder generation. Real AI integration (Claude) would be a future enhancement. The existing RoadmapGenerator is designed for regenerating roadmaps from existing projects, not generating from scratch.
