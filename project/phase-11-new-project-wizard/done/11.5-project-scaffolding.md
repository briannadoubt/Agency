# 11.5 Project Scaffolding & Completion

Summary:
Create project folder structure from roadmap and architecture, show scaffolding progress, then open the new project.

Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Blue circular spinner (ProgressView)
- [x] "Scaffolding project files..." headline
- [x] Subtext: "Generating .md files, creating folder structure, and initializing the board."
- [x] ProjectScaffolder model to orchestrate creation
- [x] Prompt for folder location (NSOpenPanel or NSSavePanel for folder)
- [x] Create project folder with name from step 1
- [x] Write ROADMAP.md with edited content
- [x] Write ARCHITECTURE.md if generated (optional)
- [x] Parse roadmap and create phase folders (phase-1-name/, phase-2-name/, etc.)
- [x] Create backlog/in-progress/done subfolders in each phase
- [x] Generate task cards in backlog/ from roadmap tasks
- [x] CompletionStepView with success message and "Open Project" button
