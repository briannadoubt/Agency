# 11.0 Phase Plan — New Project Wizard

Summary:
Add a guided wizard UI for creating new Agency projects, with AI-generated roadmap and architecture, live preview editing, and automatic folder scaffolding.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Goal Input step collects project name and vision
- [ ] AI generates roadmap from project goal
- [ ] Roadmap review allows editing with live preview
- [ ] AI generates architecture from roadmap
- [ ] Architecture review allows editing with live preview
- [ ] Scaffolding creates folder structure and files
- [ ] Completion step opens new project

Notes:
Phase planning document for the New Project Wizard feature.

Goal:

Add a "New Project" wizard UI that guides users through creating a new Agency project. The wizard collects project name and goal, generates a roadmap via AI, allows editing with live preview, optionally generates architecture, then scaffolds the folder structure.

## User Flow

1. **Goal Input** - Enter project name and describe vision/goals
2. **Generating Roadmap** - Loading state while AI creates roadmap
3. **Review Roadmap** - Edit markdown with live phase/task preview
4. **Generating Architecture** - Loading state while AI creates architecture
5. **Review Architecture** - Edit markdown with live component preview (skippable)
6. **Scaffolding** - Loading state while creating files
7. **Complete** - Success, open new project

## Design Reference

See `project/phase-11-new-project-wizard/done/design/` for UI mockups.

## Key Components

- NewProjectWizardView - Main wizard container with step navigation
- WizardState - Observable state tracking current step and accumulated data
- ProjectGoalStepView - Name and goal input
- GeneratingStepView - Loading animation during roadmap generation
- RoadmapReviewStepView - Editable roadmap with preview sidebar
- GeneratingArchitectureView - Loading animation during architecture generation
- ArchitectureReviewStepView - Editable architecture with preview sidebar
- ScaffoldingStepView - Loading animation during file creation
- CompletionStepView - Success state with open button
- ProjectScaffolder - Model orchestrating folder/file creation

## Dependencies

- RoadmapGenerator (existing)
- ArchitectureGenerator (existing)
- RoadmapTaskMaterializer (existing)
- ProjectLoader (for opening new project)
