# Phase 11: New Project Wizard

## Goal

Add a "New Project" wizard UI that guides users through creating a new Agency project. The wizard collects project name and goal, generates a roadmap via AI, allows editing with live preview, optionally generates architecture, then scaffolds the folder structure.

## User Flow

1. **Goal Input** - Enter project name and describe vision/goals
2. **Generating Roadmap** - Loading state while AI creates roadmap
3. **Review Roadmap** - Edit markdown with live phase/task preview
4. **Generating Architecture** - Loading state while AI creates architecture
5. **Review Architecture** - Edit markdown with live component preview (skippable)
6. **Scaffolding** - Loading state while creating files
7. **Complete** - Success, open new project
