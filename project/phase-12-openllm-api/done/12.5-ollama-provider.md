# 12.5 Ollama Provider Integration

Summary:
Implement a concrete Ollama provider that extends the OpenAI-compatible base with Ollama-specific features like model management and native API support.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Create `OllamaProvider` extending `OpenAICompatibleProvider`
- [x] Default endpoint: `http://localhost:11434/v1/`
- [x] Implement model listing via Ollama API (`/api/tags`)
- [x] Add health check for Ollama server availability
- [x] Support both OpenAI-compatible and native Ollama endpoints
- [x] Handle Ollama-specific response format differences
- [x] Add provider to registry with auto-discovery
- [x] Settings UI for Ollama endpoint and model selection
- [x] Integration tests with local Ollama (when available)

Notes:
- Ollama is the most popular local model server
- Supports both `/api/chat` (native) and `/v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible)
- Model names like "llama3.2", "codellama", "deepseek-coder"
- Consider auto-detecting Ollama on default port
- Tool use support varies by model (llama3.2 supports it)

History:
- 2025-12-18: Card created from Phase 12 planning.
- 2025-12-20: Implemented OllamaProvider with model listing, health checks, model pulling, auto-detection factory methods, and unit tests.
