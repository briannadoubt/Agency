# 12.4 Tool Execution Bridge

Summary:
Create a bridge that executes tool calls from HTTP-based agents using the existing XPC worker infrastructure, maintaining the security sandbox.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Create `ToolExecutionBridge` that receives tool call requests
- [x] Define `ToolCall` struct matching OpenAI function call format
- [x] Map tool names to execution handlers (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep)
- [x] Execute tools via XPC worker for sandboxed file/process access
- [x] Return structured `ToolResult` with output or error
- [x] Handle tool execution timeouts
- [x] Support parallel tool execution when safe
- [x] Implement tool allowlist enforcement per provider
- [x] Unit tests for tool routing and result formatting

Notes:
- Reuse XPC infrastructure from Phase 5/9 for security
- Tool schemas should match what models expect (OpenAI function format)
- Consider caching file reads within a single agent turn
- Bash execution needs careful sandboxing
- May need to extend WorkerRunRequest for tool-only execution

History:
- 2025-12-18: Card created from Phase 12 planning.
- 2025-12-20: Implemented ToolExecutionBridge actor with all 6 tools (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep), timeout handling, allowlist enforcement, and unit tests.
