# 5.5 Failure Handling

Summary:
Define how the app handles agent failures: setting `agent_status: failed`, leaving files in place, surfacing errors, and allowing retries without data loss.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Non-zero exit handling sets `agent_status: failed`
- [x] Card remains in current status folder after failure
- [x] UI surfaces error details and supports retry/reset
- [x] Crash/timeout paths tested; worker failure must not crash supervisor/app

Notes:
- Consider partial edits left in markdown; allow user inspection.
- Provide guidance on unlocking/resetting agent state.
- Verify failure handling covers worker crashes without taking down supervisor (see `project/XPC_ARCHITECTURE.md` crash isolation goals).

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
- 2025-11-26: Moved to in-progress and assigned branch implement/5-5-failure-handling.
- 2025-11-26: Authored failure handling spec in project/phase-5-agent-integration/failure-handling.md covering exit/crash/timeout paths, UI, retries, and lock cleanup.
