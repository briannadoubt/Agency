# 5.6 Human Override

Summary:
Document manual override behaviors: users may edit frontmatter, reset agent status to idle, and rerun flows while the app prevents blocking manual edits.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Users can reset `agent_status` to `idle` manually
- [x] Manual edits to frontmatter are respected and reloaded
- [x] UI allows rerunning flows after manual override without conflicts

Notes:
- Ensure clear messaging when overrides bypass automation.
- Consider audit trails in History when overrides occur.
- Keep overrides compatible with XPC status reporting described in `project/XPC_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
