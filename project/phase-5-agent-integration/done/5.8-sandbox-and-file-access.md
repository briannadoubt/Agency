# 5.8 Sandbox & File Access

Summary:
Enforce the file access model from `project/XPC_ARCHITECTURE.md`: security-scoped bookmarks for project roots, read-only mounts for inputs, and scoped temp output directories per worker.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Workers resolve project bookmark with `.withSecurityScope` and read-only semantics by default
- [x] Workers receive per-task temp dirs for outputs; supervisor cleans them up on completion
- [x] App never directly accesses worker internals; supervisor mediates sandbox permissions
- [x] No write outside scoped dirs; error surfaced on bookmark failure

Notes:
- Ensure bookmarks are refreshed/renewed gracefully on long-lived sessions.
- Keep inputs immutable; only temp output locations are writable.
- Document fallback for bookmark failure (surface error, do not broaden access).

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-26: Completed; sandboxed file access enforced and verified by tests.
- 2025-11-26: Implemented sandboxed worker I/O (read-only bookmark resolution, scoped temp dirs), added tests; still In Progress pending review.
- 2025-11-26: Moved to in-progress; updating branch and status.
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
