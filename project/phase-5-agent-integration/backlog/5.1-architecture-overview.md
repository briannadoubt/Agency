# 5.1 Architecture Overview

Summary:
Define the SwiftUI frontend + XPC worker architecture per `project/XPC_ARCHITECTURE.md`: sandboxed UI + scheduler, supervisor service, and isolated worker jobs that run Codex with scoped filesystem access.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document separation of concerns among app, supervisor, and worker processes
- [ ] XPC worker runs Codex with controlled permissions and returns results via `XPCEndpoint`
- [ ] Security-scoped bookmarks are considered for project access
- [ ] Capability sandbox checklist enforced; per-run logs/metrics captured

Notes:
- Keep agents confined to XPC; UI never runs Codex directly.
- Plan for crash isolation and error propagation.
- Use the Host App → CodexSupervisor.xpc → Worker chain from the architecture doc.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
