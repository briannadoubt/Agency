# 10.0 Phase Plan — Supervisor UI Integration

Summary:
Connect the SupervisorCoordinator infrastructure to the UI, enabling users to start/stop/pause automatic background processing, view supervisor status, and manage flow pipelines from the app.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] UI controls for supervisor start/stop/pause
- [ ] Status indicator showing supervisor state and active runs
- [ ] Pipeline selection per card
- [ ] Cost/metrics visibility from completed runs
- [ ] Settings integration for supervisor configuration

Notes:
The supervisor infrastructure (SupervisorCoordinator, BacklogWatcher, FlowPipelineOrchestrator) is complete but not yet exposed in the UI. This phase connects that infrastructure to user-facing controls.

## Tasks

### 10.1 Supervisor Status View
Add a status indicator to the main UI showing:
- Supervisor state (stopped/running/paused)
- Active run count and queue depth
- Quick start/stop/pause controls

### 10.2 Supervisor Settings
Add settings for:
- Auto-start supervisor on project open
- Max concurrent runs
- Default pipeline selection
- Backoff/retry configuration

### 10.3 Card Pipeline Selection
Allow users to:
- Select pipeline for individual cards (implement-only, implement-review, etc.)
- Override default pipeline from card context menu
- View current pipeline progress for in-flight cards

### 10.4 Run History & Metrics
Display:
- Recent run history with costs
- Success/failure rates
- Time-to-completion metrics

### 10.5 Auto-Move to Done
Automatically move cards to done/ folder when:
- Pipeline completes successfully
- All acceptance criteria marked complete
- Review flow passes (if included in pipeline)

History:
- 2025-12-07 - Phase planned
