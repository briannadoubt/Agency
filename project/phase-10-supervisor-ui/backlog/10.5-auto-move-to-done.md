# 10.5 Auto-Move to Done

Summary:
Automatically move cards to done/ folder when pipeline completes successfully with all criteria met.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Setting toggle: "Auto-move completed cards to Done"
- [ ] On pipeline completion, check if all acceptance criteria are marked [x]
- [ ] If review was included, ensure review passed (no blocking findings)
- [ ] Use CardMover to move card to done/ folder
- [ ] Update card frontmatter (agent_status: completed)
- [ ] Add history entry for automatic completion

Notes:
CardMover already handles filesystem moves. Need to integrate with FlowPipelineOrchestrator's `pipelineComplete` action. Consider optional review gating.
