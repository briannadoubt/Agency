# 10.4 Run History & Metrics

Summary:
Display run history with costs, success rates, and performance metrics in a dedicated view or panel.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] RunHistoryView showing recent completed runs
- [ ] Each run displays: card, flow, duration, cost, status
- [ ] Aggregate metrics: total cost, success rate, average duration
- [ ] Filter by date range, flow type, or status
- [ ] Persist run history to disk (SupervisorStateStore or separate)

Notes:
WorkerRunResult contains duration, cost data. Need to persist completed runs beyond current session. Consider storing in `~/Library/Application Support/Agency/run-history.json`.

Key files:
- Agency/Supervisor/AgentRunModels.swift (WorkerRunResult)
- Agency/Supervisor/SupervisorStateStore.swift

History:
- 2025-12-07 - Card created
