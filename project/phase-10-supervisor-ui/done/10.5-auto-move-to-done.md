# 10.5 Auto-Move to Done

Summary:
Automatically move cards to done/ folder when pipeline completes successfully with all criteria met.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Setting toggle: "Auto-move completed cards to Done"
- [x] On pipeline completion, check if all acceptance criteria are marked [x]
- [x] If review was included, ensure review passed (no blocking findings)
- [x] Use CardMover to move card to done/ folder
- [x] Update card frontmatter (agent_status: completed)
- [x] Add history entry for automatic completion

Notes:
CardMover already handles filesystem moves. Need to integrate with FlowPipelineOrchestrator's `pipelineComplete` action. Consider optional review gating.
