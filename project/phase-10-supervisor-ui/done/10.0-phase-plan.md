# 10.0 Phase Plan — Supervisor UI Integration

Summary:
Connect the SupervisorCoordinator infrastructure to the UI, enabling users to start/stop/pause automatic background processing, view supervisor status, and manage flow pipelines from the app.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] UI controls for supervisor start/stop/pause → 10.1
- [x] Status indicator showing supervisor state and active runs → 10.1
- [x] Pipeline selection per card → 10.3
- [x] Cost/metrics visibility from completed runs → 10.4
- [x] Settings integration for supervisor configuration → 10.2

Notes:
The supervisor infrastructure (SupervisorCoordinator, BacklogWatcher, FlowPipelineOrchestrator) is complete but not yet exposed in the UI. This phase connects that infrastructure to user-facing controls.

## Tasks

### 10.1 Supervisor Status View
Add a status indicator to the main UI showing:
- Supervisor state (stopped/running/paused)
- Active run count and queue depth
- Quick start/stop/pause controls

### 10.2 Supervisor Settings
Add settings for:
- Auto-start supervisor on project open
- Max concurrent runs
- Default pipeline selection
- Backoff/retry configuration

### 10.3 Card Pipeline Selection
Allow users to:
- Select pipeline for individual cards (implement-only, implement-review, etc.)
- Override default pipeline from card context menu
- View current pipeline progress for in-flight cards

### 10.4 Run History & Metrics
Display:
- Recent run history with costs
- Success/failure rates
- Time-to-completion metrics

### 10.5 Auto-Move to Done
Automatically move cards to done/ folder when:
- Pipeline completes successfully
- All acceptance criteria marked complete
- Review flow passes (if included in pipeline)

## UI Integration Points

Based on ContentView analysis:
- **Sidebar "Status" section** (line 59): Add supervisor state indicator here
- **Board Header**: Add supervisor controls and active run count
- **Card Context Menu**: Add "Run with Pipeline..." option
- **Settings**: New section for supervisor configuration
- **Card Detail Modal**: Show pipeline progress for in-flight cards

## Implementation Order

1. **10.1 Supervisor Status View** - Foundation for supervisor visibility
2. **10.2 Supervisor Settings** - Configuration before auto-features
3. **10.3 Card Pipeline Selection** - Per-card control
4. **10.4 Run History & Metrics** - Observability
5. **10.5 Auto-Move to Done** - Automation (depends on 10.1-10.3)

History:
- 2025-12-07 - Phase planned
- 2025-12-07 - Task breakdown complete, UI integration points identified
