# 4.2 Branch Helper

Summary:
Generate a recommended git branch name for a card, copy it to the clipboard, and write it into frontmatter, providing a command snippet for quick terminal usage.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Recommended branch name format (e.g., `implement/<code>-<slug>`) is produced
- [ ] Branch name can be copied to clipboard with one click
- [ ] Frontmatter branch field is updated when applied
- [ ] Slug normalization enforced; updates frontmatter without reordering other keys

Notes:
- Consider configurable branch prefix per flow.
- Provide safe handling when frontmatter is absent.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
