# 4.4 Search

Summary:
Provide filtering and search across cards by code, partial code, owner, title, summary, or notes, with instant results as the user types.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Search filters by full or partial card code
- [x] Can filter by owner from frontmatter
- [x] Text search matches title, summary, or notes with live updates
- [x] In-memory filtering over ~1k cards completes in <200ms; highlights query matches

Notes:
- Consider highlighting matched terms in results.
- Keep searches case-insensitive by default.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.

- 2025-11-25: Work started; moved to in-progress.
- 2025-11-25: Added search bar with code/title/notes filtering, owner filter, and highlighting; added regression tests.
