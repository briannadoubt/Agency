# 4.1 Claim Card

Summary:
Automatically locate the lowest-numbered backlog card, move it to in-progress, optionally set owner to current user, and record the action in History.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Finds lowest code card in Backlog deterministically
- [x] Moves card to In-Progress folder on claim
- [x] Optionally sets owner and appends History entry describing claim
- [x] Completes in <200ms on ~1k cards; refuses claim if card locked/agent running

Notes:
- Consider race conditions with concurrent claims.
- Provide a dry-run path to preview which card will be claimed.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
