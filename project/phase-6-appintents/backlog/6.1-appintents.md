# 6.1 AppIntents

Summary:
Research and plan AppIntents integration so the Agency app can expose intents without introducing build warnings.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Summarize AppIntents capabilities relevant to Agency (Shortcuts, App Shortcuts, parameters, donation/eligibility)
- [ ] Produce an implementation plan covering intent definitions, invocation points, and required app metadata
- [ ] Identify platform/version constraints and any entitlements or privacy copy needed for shipping
- [ ] Outline validation strategy (unit/UI tests, simulator setup) to keep warnings at zero with warnings-as-errors enabled

Notes:
- Compile-time warnings are treated as errors; design the plan to maintain a clean build.
- Coordinate intent surfaces with upcoming UI flows once available.

History:
