# 7.4 ARCHITECTURE.md Generation

Summary:
Generate ARCHITECTURE.md from the roadmap so each project has a living technical blueprint covering stack choices, platforms, and implementation strategy.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Define ARCHITECTURE.md template/sections (goals, constraints, system overview, components, data/storage, integrations, testing/observability, risks)
- [ ] Derive content from ROADMAP.md (phases/tasks) plus user-provided inputs (target platforms, languages, tech stack)
- [ ] Support regeneration when the roadmap changes while preserving manual annotations where possible
- [ ] Include validation to ensure required sections are present and current
- [ ] Add tests that verify generated architecture output for sample projects

Notes:
- Keep style concise and consistent with ROADMAP.md phrasing
- Plan for future MCP/agent extension to update architecture as tasks complete

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for architecture generation.
