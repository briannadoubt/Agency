# 7.5 Validation & E2E Tests

Summary:
Add validation, safeguards, and end-to-end tests for the roadmap-driven initialization flow across both existing and new project directories.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Extend ConventionsValidator (or new checks) to cover ROADMAP schema, ARCHITECTURE.md presence, and generated card correctness
- [ ] Add integration tests that run the initializer in a temp empty dir and a populated dir with existing cards
- [ ] Ensure flows are idempotent and report pending/manual actions instead of overwriting without consent
- [ ] Document failure modes and recovery steps (e.g., stale roadmap, schema mismatch, partial writes)
- [ ] Wire tests into CI/make targets used before PR completion

Notes:
- Reuse existing testing harnesses where possible; keep runtime low
- Include fixtures for sample ROADMAP.md and expected outputs

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for validation and E2E coverage.
