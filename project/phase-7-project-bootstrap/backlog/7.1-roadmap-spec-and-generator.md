# 7.1 ROADMAP Spec & Generator

Summary:
Define the canonical ROADMAP.md structure and build a generator that can author or refresh it from a high-level project goal, producing phase/task/subtask entries suitable for downstream materialization.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Specify ROADMAP.md schema: phase ordering, task identifiers, optional metadata (owners, risks), version tag
- [ ] Provide markdown template and example aligned with existing phases
- [ ] Implement generator that accepts a project brief/goal and outputs a validated ROADMAP.md; supports regeneration without losing manual edits where possible
- [ ] Validate existing ROADMAP.md files and surface actionable errors/upgrades
- [ ] Add tests covering schema parsing, generation, and idempotent regeneration paths

Notes:
- Keep output compatible with PROJECT_WORKFLOW conventions and phase folder naming
- Consider hooks for future MCP/agent-driven roadmap creation

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for Phase 7 roadmap specification and generator.
