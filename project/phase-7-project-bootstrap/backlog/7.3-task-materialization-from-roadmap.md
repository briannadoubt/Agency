# 7.3 Task Materialization from ROADMAP

Summary:
Create the engine that turns ROADMAP.md into per-phase task files with proper frontmatter, sections, and naming, populating the backlog folders automatically.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Generate Markdown cards for each roadmap task/subtask with standard sections (Summary, Acceptance Criteria, Notes, History)
- [ ] Ensure filenames follow `<phase>.<task>-slug.md` and land in the correct `project/phase-N-*/backlog/` folder
- [ ] Preserve or merge existing cards when regenerating; avoid duplicate codes and keep History intact when possible
- [ ] Validate output with ConventionsValidator and fail on schema mismatches
- [ ] Provide tests for single-phase and multi-phase materialization, including idempotent reruns

Notes:
- Align generated frontmatter fields with existing cards (owner/risk/review defaults)
- Consider partial generation when only a subset of phases changes

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for roadmap-to-task materialization.
