# 7.2 Project Initialization CLI

Summary:
Implement a CLI/agent flow that initializes a project either in an existing folder or by creating a new folder, using ROADMAP.md as the single source of truth for structure and tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Support initializing in-place (non-empty directory) without destructive changes; gracefully handle conflicts
- [ ] Support creating a new project directory with the roadmap-generated structure
- [ ] Reads or generates ROADMAP.md and uses it to lay out phase folders and stub files
- [ ] Provides dry-run/output preview and clear prompts/flags for interactive vs scripted use
- [ ] Adds tests for both existing-folder and new-folder scenarios

Notes:
- Respect git state; avoid overwriting existing cards without explicit confirmation
- Consider environment variable/flag to select templates or minimal mode

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for Phase 7 initialization CLI.
