# 7.0 Phase Plan — Project Bootstrap

Summary:
Outline Phase 7 to deliver roadmap-driven project bootstrapping that works for both existing directories and brand-new projects, producing ROADMAP.md, card scaffolding, and ARCHITECTURE.md.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Describe Phase 7 objectives and scope (roadmap generator, project initializer for existing/new folders, task + folder materialization, architecture generation)
- [ ] Enumerate planned cards (7.1–7.5) with responsibilities and dependencies, aligned to current agent/plan flows
- [ ] Capture risks, assumptions, and guardrails (idempotency, non-destructive operations, validation)
- [ ] Define validation strategy (unit + end-to-end) and success measures for bootstrap flows
- [ ] Add History entry dated 2025-11-29 documenting creation

Notes:
- Align with Phase 6 plan flow outputs so card creation stays compatible with ConventionsValidator
- Consider feature flag / config to disable auto-materialization in sensitive repos

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for Phase 7 planning.
