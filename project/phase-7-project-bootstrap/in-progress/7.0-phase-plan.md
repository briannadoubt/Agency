# 7.0 Phase Plan — Project Bootstrap

Summary:
Outline Phase 7 to deliver roadmap-driven project bootstrapping that works for both existing directories and brand-new projects, producing ROADMAP.md, card scaffolding, and ARCHITECTURE.md.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Describe Phase 7 objectives and scope (roadmap generator, project initializer for existing/new folders, task + folder materialization, architecture generation)
- [x] Enumerate planned cards (7.1–7.5) with responsibilities and dependencies, aligned to current agent/plan flows
- [x] Capture risks, assumptions, and guardrails (idempotency, non-destructive operations, validation)
- [x] Define validation strategy (unit + end-to-end) and success measures for bootstrap flows
- [x] Add History entry dated 2025-11-29 documenting creation

Notes:
- Align with Phase 6 plan flow outputs so card creation stays compatible with ConventionsValidator
- Consider feature flag / config to disable auto-materialization in sensitive repos

Objectives & Scope:
- ROADMAP.md spec/generator is the single source of truth for phases, tasks, and metadata; supports regeneration without clobbering curated edits.
- Project initializer runs in-place or in a new directory, honoring existing git state and refusing destructive operations by default.
- Task + folder materialization converts roadmap entries into backlog cards with correct frontmatter/layout, staying consistent with Phase 6 plan artifacts and ConventionsValidator.
- ARCHITECTURE.md is produced from roadmap + stack/platform inputs so new projects ship with a living technical blueprint.

Planned Cards & Dependencies (7.1–7.5):
- 7.1 ROADMAP Spec & Generator: define schema/template, generate/refresh ROADMAP.md, validate existing files; foundational for all other cards.
- 7.2 Project Initialization CLI: consumes ROADMAP.md (from 7.1) to scaffold new or existing directories; must integrate with plan artifacts created in Phase 6.
- 7.3 Task Materialization from ROADMAP: turns roadmap tasks into per-phase backlog cards; depends on 7.1 schema and feeds 7.2 outputs.
- 7.4 ARCHITECTURE.md Generation: derives architecture doc from roadmap plus user inputs; builds on 7.1 data and card materialization signals.
- 7.5 Validation & E2E Tests: extends ConventionsValidator and adds end-to-end coverage across new/existing dir flows; validates outputs from 7.1–7.4.

Risks, Assumptions, Guardrails:
- Idempotency: regeneration of ROADMAP.md, cards, and ARCHITECTURE.md must be repeatable; prefer diff-safe writes and backups.
- Non-destructive defaults: initializer refuses to overwrite existing files without explicit flags; dry-run previews required before writes.
- Validation-first: schema and ConventionsValidator checks gate writes; partial failures surface actionable recovery steps.
- Compatibility: preserve manual History entries and frontmatter fields when re-materializing; honor feature flags to disable auto-materialization in sensitive repos.
- Git hygiene: flows must respect dirty worktrees and avoid committing artifacts; interactive prompts available but scriptable flags remain.

Validation Strategy & Success Measures:
- Unit coverage for roadmap parser/generator (7.1), initializer orchestration (7.2), card materializer (7.3), architecture builder (7.4), and validators.
- End-to-end tests that run initializer in empty and pre-populated directories, asserting idempotent reruns and clean ConventionsValidator output.
- Success criteria: generated roadmap/cards/architecture pass validation, no unintended overwrites in existing repos, and bootstrap completes with clear logs and recovery guidance.

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for Phase 7 planning.
- 2025-11-29: Moved to In Progress on branch implement/7.0-phase-plan; outlined Phase 7 scope, dependencies, guardrails, and validation approach.
