# 3.4 Frontmatter Editor

Summary:
Provide UI to detect, add, and edit YAML frontmatter fields with validation, including drop-downs for risk and review states, while preserving clean formatting if frontmatter was absent.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Frontmatter is detected and fields are editable; can be added if missing
- [ ] Risk and review fields use constrained selections
- [ ] YAML validation runs before writing changes back
- [ ] Preserves ordering of unknown keys; rejects invalid YAML with inline error messaging

Notes:
- Maintain indentation and ordering when rewriting frontmatter.
- Preserve card content outside the frontmatter block.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
