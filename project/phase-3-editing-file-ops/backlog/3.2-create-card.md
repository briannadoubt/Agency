# 3.2 Create Card

Summary:
Enable creating a new card by prompting for a title, auto-generating the next task number in the current phase, producing a kebab-case slug, and writing a markdown file using the standard template.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Prompt captures card title within the current phase
- [ ] Next task number is computed automatically and slug is kebab-case
- [ ] New markdown file is written with standard template and correct path
- [ ] Validates filename uniqueness per phase; template may include optional initial History entry

Notes:
- Handle zero-padding or numeric sorting consistently.
- Prevent overwriting existing files; warn on collisions.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
