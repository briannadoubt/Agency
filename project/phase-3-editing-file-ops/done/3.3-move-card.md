# 3.3 Move Card

Summary:
Implement drag-based moves between status columns that relocate the markdown file on disk, validate legal transitions, update live models, and optionally log movement in History.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Dragging between columns moves the file to the corresponding status folder
- [x] Moves are validated (no illegal skips) before execution
- [x] Models refresh immediately after a move; optional History entry can be added

Notes:
- Use atomic file moves to avoid partial state.
- Consider undo support for accidental moves.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
