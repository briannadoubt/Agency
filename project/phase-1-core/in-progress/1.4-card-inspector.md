# 1.4 Card Inspector

Summary:
Show parsed card details (title, summary, acceptance criteria, notes) in a read-only pane with an "Open in Editor" action and hooks for future inline editing.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Inspector displays parsed title, summary, criteria, and notes
- [x] View is read-only initially
- [x] Provides an "Open in Editor" button

Notes:
- Prepare data bindings for future edit mode without enabling writes yet.
- Consider linking to default editor via NSWorkspace.
- Draft state mirrors parsed cards so fields can be toggled to editable later without refactoring.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.


History:
- 2025-11-23: Added read-only inspector pane with editor launch action and stateful draft bindings.
- 2025-11-22: Card created by agent.
