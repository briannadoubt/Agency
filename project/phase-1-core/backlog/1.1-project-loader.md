# 1.1 Project Loader

Summary:
Present an open dialog to pick a project directory, validate it contains `project/`, and trigger an immediate scan/load with reload hooks on filesystem changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Open dialog selects a directory and stores bookmark/reference
- [ ] Loader validates presence of `project/` root before proceeding
- [ ] Scan runs on load and re-runs when filesystem changes are detected
- [ ] Debounced watcher handles external edits; load of ~1k cards completes in <500ms on M-series Mac

Notes:
- Consider macOS security-scoped bookmarks for persistence.
- Hook into file watcher to trigger rescan.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
