# 1.2 Phase Sidebar

Summary:
Display phases sorted numerically with labels derived from directory names, highlight the selected phase, and refresh the kanban board when selection changes.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Sidebar lists all phases in numeric order
- [x] Selected phase is visibly highlighted
- [x] Changing selection triggers kanban refresh for that phase

Notes:
- Phase label comes from `phase-<N>-<label>` directory name.
- Consider keyboard navigation for phase switching.

Alignment:
- Meets roadmap acceptance for performance/a11y/safety for this phase.
- Preserves markdown structure and frontmatter ordering on save.
- Adds a YYYY-MM-DD entry to History when meaningful changes are made.
