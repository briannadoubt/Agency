# 9.5 Agent Session UI

Summary:
Build the user interface for running and monitoring Claude Code agent sessions from cards.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Add "Run with Agent" button to card detail view (backlog cards only)
- [ ] Create `AgentSessionView` with terminal-like scrolling output display
- [ ] Show real-time streaming of assistant messages and tool calls
- [ ] Display progress indicator and current tool being used
- [ ] Show accumulated cost in real-time
- [ ] Add cancel button with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Display final result summary when session completes

Notes:
- Use monospace font for output display
- Color-code tool calls vs assistant text
- Auto-scroll to bottom as new output arrives
- Disable "Run with Agent" while session is active
- Consider sheet/modal vs inline display

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created from Phase 9 planning.
