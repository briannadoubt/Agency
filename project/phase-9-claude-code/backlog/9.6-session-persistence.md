# 9.6 Session Persistence & Resume

Summary:
Enable pausing and resuming Claude Code sessions, with session state tracked per card.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Store session ID in card frontmatter or separate metadata file
- [ ] Implement resume using `claude --resume <session-id>` flag
- [ ] Track session state: idle, running, paused, completed, failed
- [ ] Clean up stale/orphaned sessions on app launch
- [ ] Add "Resume Session" button for paused sessions
- [ ] Show session history with timestamps and outcomes per card

Notes:
- Session IDs are UUIDs assigned by Claude Code
- Paused = user cancelled mid-execution
- Failed = non-zero exit or error during execution
- Consider storing session log for debugging

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created from Phase 9 planning.
