# 9.1 ClaudeCodeLocator & Settings

Summary:
Implement discovery of the Claude Code CLI binary and Settings UI for configuration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Implement `ClaudeCodeLocator` to find `claude` binary in PATH and common locations
- [ ] Check `/usr/local/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, Homebrew paths, npm global bin
- [ ] Verify CLI responds to `claude --version`
- [ ] Add Settings view with field for custom binary path override
- [ ] Store settings in UserDefaults (path only, not secrets)
- [ ] Surface clear error in UI if CLI not found with installation instructions

Notes:
- Common install paths: `/usr/local/bin/claude`, `~/.local/bin/claude`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/claude`
- Use `which claude` as fallback for PATH resolution
- Cache discovered path to avoid repeated lookups
- Settings UI should show current detected path and allow override
