# 9.0 Claude Code Planning

Summary:
Plan integration with Claude Code CLI to enable agent-driven task execution directly from the Agency app.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document Phase 9 goals for Claude Code integration, including desired user flows and outcomes
- [ ] Research Claude Code CLI capabilities, arguments, and output formats
- [ ] Define follow-on cards for implementation phases
- [ ] Capture dependencies/constraints (CLI location, environment, permissions)
- [ ] Define validation expectations with warnings-as-errors enabled

Notes:
- Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, providing agentic coding capabilities.
- Integration should allow spawning Claude Code sessions from cards with context.
- Consider security implications of executing external CLI tools.

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created for Phase 9 planning.
