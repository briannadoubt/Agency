# 9.3 ClaudeCodeExecutor

Summary:
Create the AgentExecutor implementation for Claude Code that integrates with the existing XPC worker pipeline.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Create `ClaudeCodeExecutor` struct conforming to `AgentExecutor` protocol
- [x] Add `.claudeCode` case to `AgentBackendKind` enum
- [x] Build `CodexRunRequest` with Claude-specific arguments in `cliArgs`
- [x] Register `ClaudeCodeExecutor` in `AgentRunner` initializer
- [x] Include CLI path and API key reference in request payload
- [x] Follow same patterns as `CLIPhaseExecutor` and `CodexAgentExecutor`

Notes:
- Uses existing `SupervisorClient` to launch workers
- Passes Claude-specific config via `CodexRunRequest.cliArgs`
- Worker runtime handles actual `claude` process spawning (card 9.4)
- API key passed via environment variable to worker

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created from Phase 9 planning.
- 2025-11-30: Implemented ClaudeCodeExecutor with CLI spawning, added .claudeCode backend kind, registered in AgentRunner, added resolvedProjectRoot extension, wrote unit tests.
- 2025-11-30: Moved from In Progress to Done.
