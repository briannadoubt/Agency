# 8.2 Card Query Intents

Summary:
Implement read-only intents for querying project status and cards with Spotlight integration.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Implement ProjectStatusIntent returning aggregate card counts by status
- [x] Add optional phaseNumber filter to ListCardsIntent
- [x] Create CardQuery conforming to EntityQuery for Spotlight indexing
- [x] Write unit tests for intent perform() methods

Notes:
- ProjectStatusIntent should return counts like "3 backlog, 2 in-progress, 5 done".
- CardQuery enables typing card titles in Spotlight to find cards.
- Tests should mock ProjectLoader to avoid filesystem dependencies.

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created from Phase 8 planning.
- 2025-11-29: Implemented ProjectStatusIntent, phaseNumber filter, EntityStringQuery with search, and unit tests.
