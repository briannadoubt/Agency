# 8.3 Card Mutation Intents

Summary:
Implement intents that modify cards: moving between statuses and creating new cards.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Implement MoveCardIntent with cardCode and targetStatus parameters
- [ ] Implement CreateCardIntent with phaseNumber, title, and summary parameters
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully with IntentError responses
- [ ] Ensure all file operations remain on MainActor
- [ ] Write unit tests covering success and error paths

Notes:
- MoveCardIntent must respect CardStatus.canTransition() rules.
- CreateCardIntent should use CardCreator for consistency.
- Return meaningful error messages for invalid transitions or missing phases.

History:
- 2025-11-29: Card created from Phase 8 planning.
